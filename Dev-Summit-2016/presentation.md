#What's New in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript
Julie Powell, Yann Cabon, and Heather Gonzago

---

## 3.x
 - [Geometry Engine](http://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/samples/ge_geodesic_buffers/)
 - [Smart Mapping](http://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/samples/smartmapping_bycolor/)
 - [Image Server](http://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/samples/layers_imageservicevector/)
 - [Quantization](demos/quantization/PIXELATE_ALL_THE_POLYGONS.html) vs. [Generalization](demos/quantization/TRIANGULATE_ALL_THE_POLYGONS.html)

---

## 4.0 - highlights
 - 2D/3D
 - 4.0beta1 released July 15th!
 - multiple betas coming
 - API 4.0: new concepts & changes
 - IE9+ for 2D, IE11+ for 3D

---

## 2D/3D
 - Starting point of 4.0: 3D is coming!
 - currently in [3.x](http://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/samples/map_simple/):
   - Map, many DOM nodes
   - Each Layer, 1 DOM Node
 - Can't work, WebGL renders in one Canvas
 - Solution?

---

## 2D/3D
 - Separate the business logic from the drawing logic.
![New model: Map/Layers + View(s)/LayerViews](images/architecture.png)
 - Communication model by __events__ and __properties watching__
   - clean decoupling
   - clearer about what's going on when something changes

---

## 2D/3D
 - For the rest, one API
 - [demo](demos/visualization/epic-citadel.html)

---

Experiment - Map running in node
![Map running in node](images/map-node.png)

---

```javascript
// create the map and its layers
var map = new Map({
  basemap: "topo"
});
map.add(new FeatureLayer(...));

// create a 3D view for the Map
var view = new SceneView({
  map: map,
  container: "viewDiv"
});
```

---

## `esri/Accessor`
 - Mixin similar to `dojo/Stateful`
 - single object constructor
 - `get()`, `set()`, `watch()`

```javascript
map.watch('basemap', function(newValue, oldValue, name, target) {
  // ...
});
```
 - support for ES7 `Object.observe()`

---

## Properties watching

 - Direct benefits:
   - remove inconsistancies between constructor, getter, setter functions, events
   - one convention everywhere. _"just need to know what properties for a class"_
   - Single object constructor, no more 3+ constructors
   - Leaner SDK: we doc only the properties, the rest is convention

 - Changes:
   - no more **_property_**-change events, use `watch()`
   - in 3.x, listen for `extent-change` event.
   - in 4.0 `extent` watchers will be call very often
   - new events and properties for animation. 

---

## Properties watching

 - Frameworks integration
   - properties are framework agnostic
   - better/easier integration

 - Examples
   - [side by side views](demos/accessor/side-by-side.html)
   - [dbind](demos/integration/dbind.html)
   - [React](http://jsbin.com/togemadodo/1/edit?js,output)
   - [camera recorder](http://output.jsbin.com/robegolosa)

---

## Layers

 - `map.layers`, a collection of the operational layers
   - mix of image AND graphics
 - Shorter names: `ArcGISTiledLayer`, `ArcGISDynamicLayer`
 - new ones:
   - `ArcGISElevationLayer`
   - `SceneLayer`
   - `GroupLayer`

---

## GroupLayer

 - New layer: GroupLayer
 - group layers together
 - structure your data visualization
 - visibility mode: `exclusive`, `independent`, `inherit`
 - listMode: `hide-children`, `hidden`
 - [demo](demos/grouplayer/index.html)

---

## Collection

 - More or less like an Array
 - `add` / `remove` / `forEach` / `map` / `find` / `findIndex`...
 - emit "change" events when something is added/removed/moved
 - used for layers, used for layers in Basemap, used for graphics...

---

## Basemap

- full fledge class `esri/Basemap`
- basemap's layers are not part of the `map.layers`, but from `map.basemap`
- contains 3 Collections: baseLayers, referenceLayers, elevationLayers
- can be set with
  - [string for esri's basemap](demos/basemap/2d.html)
  - or custom [Basemap instance](demos/basemap/2d-custom.html)
  - in 2D and [3D](demos/basemap/3d.html)

---

## Basemap

 - `basemap` as a string, creation of the appropriated Basemap instance

  ```javascript
  var map = new Map({
    basemap: 'topo'
  });

  map.basemap = 'streets';
  ```

 - `basemap` as an instance of `Basemap`

  ```javascript
  var map = new Map({/*...*/});

  var toner = new Basemap({
    baseLayers: [
      new WebTiledLayer({
        urlTemplate: '...'
      })
    ]
  })

  map.basemap = toner;
  ```

---

## 2D
 - new "engine" in the work.
 - faster, more future proof
   - abstraction to draw tiles and dynamic images to ease custom layers/layerviews
   - abstraction to draw in DOM or Canvas, possibly webgl ;-)
 - display graphics while zooming.
 - rotation
 - continous zoom
 - [vector map tiles](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2015/07/20/vector-tiles-preview/), [basemaps](http://basemapsbeta.arcgis.com/preview/app/index.html)

---

## 3D
 - webgl engine to display the earth.
 - [z/m support](http://maps.esri.com/rc/sat/index.html) in the API, tasks, layers...
 - support for simple symbols
 - new 3D Symbols

---

## Resizing logic
 - automatically measure and position the view
 - [resize by center, or not](demos/resizing/manual-resize.html)
 - better integration with responsive design pages
 - and [frameworks](demos/resizing/responsive-bootstrap.html)

---

## Padding
 - easier fullscreen view application.
 - defines inner margin to make space for UI.
 - [2D](demos/padding/2d.html)
 - [3D](demos/padding/3d.html)

---

## Animation
 - generic function `animateTo(target, options):Promise`
 - customize [easing, duration, chaining](demos/animation/random.html)
 - DIY using [other libs](demos/animation/tweenjs.html) or [custom](demos/whats-next/routing.html)
 - `esri/Viewpoint`: common way to share between 2D/3D

---

## Widgets
 - `ui` property on view to quickly place components
 - widgets designed as MVVM
   - separates the logic from the UI implementation
   - easier to create new versions using other frameworks
 - ported to 4.0beta1: Search, Zoom, Attribution
 - new ones: Compass

---

## WebMap & WebScene APIs
 - read
 - save / save as
 - easier portal / arcgis.com interaction

---

## SDK
 - new SDK, built from scratch
 - simpler, focused samples
 - user experience
 - more code snippets

---

## Other
 - legacy dojo loader removed - AMD only
 - classes properly cased: esri/Map, esri/Graphic, esri/layers/Layer
 - new folder structure.

---

## Beta2
 - initial implementation of WebMap and WebScene. reading first
 - more layer support
 - more widgets
 - performance improvements
 - 3D
   - realistic atmosphere
   - subsurface rendering
   - point cloud
   - planar mode
 - bugs...

---


## Conclusion
 - One API
 - 3D, and better 2D
 - simplified API
